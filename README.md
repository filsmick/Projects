TextShower is probably the simplest flexible solution for creating text sliders. You can either create sliders with a plug'n'play solution or customize settings page-to-page.

How to use
======

You can simply start by uploading TextShower.js or TextShower.min.js to your FTP server, then inserting this piece of code anywhere in your page : 

``` html
<div class="TextShower-box"> 
	<strong class="TextShower-title">Headlines of the text</strong> 
	<p class="TextShower-text">Text you want to be showed after click</p>
</div>
```

and embedding TextShower just before closing the \<body\> tag :

``` html
<script src="path/to/TextShower.js"></script>
```

You can create as many TextShower boxes as you want in your page. It will just be a little slower for each box. You can also add as many classes as you want to the elements.

If you want to customize the behavior of TextShower, [it's here](http://filsmick.github.io/TextShower/#advanced-use).
